# Project Architecture

## Directory Structure

> Works with React and bootstrap

```text
matrix-os/
├─ public/                 # Static assets copied as-is
├─ src/
|   └─ pages/               # React Pages
├─ package.json
└─ .env                     # Build-time env vars (never secrets)
```

### Building Blocks Responsibility

- **src/pages**: Contains React components for each application route or view. Each file under this directory represents a top-level page rendered by the router, and is styled using Bootstrap.
